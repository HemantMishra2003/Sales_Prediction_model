# About my model 

in this model .. i predicted  how much sales can be taken place 
i got 0.99 r^2 score  accuracy by 3 techniques 
random forest  and polynomial performed best 



 # About performance of my model 

 1. linear regression  , r^2 score = 0.98 , mean square error = 154
 2. polynomial regression  , r^2 score = 0.9966 , mean sqaure error = 28.75
 3. Random forest ,  r^2 score = 0.9967 , mean score error = 28.52
 4. xg boost ,  r^2 score = 0.9937 , mean score error = 52.24


#   process of making my model 

 in my original dataset quite much  misisng values  were present
 so i imputed missing values by the use of randomness technique 

 outliers too were in sales feature.. so i removed outliers
 carefully by the use of capping logic

 by corr function its tell us the efficiency of the features
 so i removed influencer column beacause it was irrelevent features...

 sacled my input features
 did train test and amke my model by 4 diffrent techniques

# plss check my model .
